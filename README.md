# Ci::Master

## Why?

In [metanorma](http://github.com/metanorma) and [relaton](http://github.com/relaton) GitHub organization there is a lot of repositories use the same CI configuration. It becomes really annoying and error-prone when we need to update CI configuration, for instance, to add new ruby version to the test matrix.

In theory, this problem easily can be solved if we can refer CI configuration (or part of the configuration) outside of the repository

But most of CI solutions don't support external configuration (i.e. Travis, GitHub Actions, Appveyor)

Namely for GitHub:
 - https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/External-workflow-configuration/td-p/33529
 - https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Call-an-action-from-another-action/td-p/45034

## Solution

Here is our soltion comes: main propose of this gem to propogate CI configuration accross all repos in [metanorma organization](https://github.com/metanorma)

## Installation

Highly likelly this gem will not be published, because it's only for internal usage

### Prerequisites

`ci-master` tool rely on external CLI tools below:

- [`repo`](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading#installing-repo)
- `pip install git-plus`
- `brew install hub`

## Usage

### Checkout all repos

These steps _need to be done once_, then you can reuse `$mn-root` for future CI configuration updates

- `mkdir $mn-root`
- `cd $mn-root`
- `repo init -u https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-build-scripts`
- `repo sync`
- `git multi checkout master`
- `echo 'metanorma-build-scripts' > .multigit_ignore`
- `git clone https://github.com/metanorma/ci-master.git`
- `cd ci-master`

### Make sure repos up-to-date

Command below need to keep your `$mn-root` up-to-date

- `repo sync`
- `bin/ci-master pull -b master -c ../metanorma-build-scripts/ci-master/config -r ../` - from `$mn-root/ci-master` directory

### Propogate changes from ci-master

Once you pushed your configuration updates to https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-build-scripts you are ready to apply them for all repos:

- `bin/ci-master sync -r ../ -c ../metanorma-build-scripts/ci-master/config` - from `$mn-root/ci-master` directory
- `cd $mn-root`

If you just wanna _push to `master`_ run commands below:

- `git multi -c add -u .github`
- `git multi commit -m "Update CI configuration due to XXX feature"`

If you wanna to _create PR_ for your changes run commands below:

- `git multi -c checkout -b feature/xxx`
- `git multi -c add -u .github`
- `git multi commit -m "Update CI configuration due to XXX feature"`
- `git multi push --set-upstream github feature/xxx`
- `for f in */; do if [ -d "$f/.git" ]; then cd $f; hub pull-request -b master -r ronaldtse -a $GITHUBUSER_NAME --no-edit; cd ..; fi; done`

### Updating default.xml

From time to time we are renaming or adding new repos this is why we need to update it from time to time

 - `bin/gh-repo-manifest -o metanorma,relaton`
 
### Updaing specific groups

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
